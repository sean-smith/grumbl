## Synopsis 
Grumbl caters to foodies who care more about the food item they want to eat, rather than the restaurant that serves it. It aims to clarify the distinction between “best restaurants” and “best dishes” by providing analysis of specific menu items. The objective is to find the best options of someone’s craving, which does not always correspond to aggregate reviews of restaurants which are often skewed by factors other than food. 

This application suggests the best dishes available depending on which ingredients the user inputs. The target market would be students in metropolitan college campuses and young urban professionals. The application’s database would store user ratings, reviews, favorites, and preferences. The app would utilize the Google Maps API, Yelp API, and Locu API (for restaurant menu information) to provide this service. The app would be comprised of saved dishes, food item search, restaurant profiles, and reviews (if available). Third-party authentication will be required from Google or Facebook.
